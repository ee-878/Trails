# Trails
Trail making game created for the Locomotor and Movement Control Lab at Auburn University for use in research projects.

This game was created to fill the need by researchers at Auburn University to have a digital version of an already existing (on paper) test known as a trail making test, 
which is commonly used in Kinesiology research. This digital version allows for either mouse or game controller (joystick only) input, and will be used in upcoming research on 
e-sports competitors. To use with a game controller, just plug it into your computer via USB and the game will auto-detect the joystick.

This game was written in Python and utilizes the Arcade library.
To run this game, clone the repository and install the pillow and arcade libraries using pip with the following commands:
pip install pillow
pip install arcade

Alternatively, you can download the executable under releases (for Windows only).

The sprite images for this game were autogenerated by the draw_bubbles script which is also included for illustrative purposes.

**Functionality/Gameplay:**
When you run the app, you will see this view first:

Once you choose the desired game mode, the game view will be presented:

The game starts once you bring the mouse to the black dot sitting on the first bubble. The purpose of this was to make the game as similar as possible to the paper test, in which the user would have to bring the pencil to the first bubble before the researcher would start the timer.
The goal of the game is to make a trail to each bubble in the correct order as quickly as possible. The correct order is either 1, 2, etc or 1, A, 2, B, etc, depending on the selected game mode.
Once the player reaches the last bubble, a screenshot is automatically taken and saved with the user data and date and time.![Evan_B_10_30_2021_19_49_17_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89755445/139564931-9fca9bac-f08b-4479-8f4f-c75b89385c72.png)

Finally, the game over screen is presented.

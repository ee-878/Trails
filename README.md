# Trails
Trail making game created for the Locomotor and Movement Control Lab at Auburn University for use in research projects.

This game was created to fill the need by researchers at Auburn University to have a digital version of an already existing (on paper) test known as a trail making test, 
which is commonly used in Kinesiology research. This digital version allows for either mouse or game controller (joystick only) input, and will be used in upcoming research on 
e-sports competitors.

This game was written in Python and utilizes the Arcade library.
To run this game, clone the repository and install the PIL and arcade libraries using pip.

The sprite images for this game were autogenerated by the draw_bubbles script which is also included for illustrative purposes.
Sections of this script were commented/modified as needed to produce the various game images.
